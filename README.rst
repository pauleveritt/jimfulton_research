Research for sprint with Jim Fulton
===================================

In September 2019, before PyColorado, I'm sprinting with Jim to learn 
some patterns about ZODB, pseudo-reactive programming, generational 
sets, references, high performance collections, etc.

Here are some things to ask Jim about.

General ZODB
============

- Scripts to pack

General Python
==============

- Circular import avoidance and ``__all__``
